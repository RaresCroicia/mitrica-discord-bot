# Contributing to Mitrica the Discord Bot

These are the basic rules that we recommend to follow when contributing to the future of Mitrica.

## First Steps

If you aren't very familiar with using git, here are some of the best tutorials

- The Git [Immersion](https://gitimmersion.com/)
- The [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/learn-git-with-bitbucket-cloud) tutorial

## Language

All of the content is developed in english and romanian. This means we use these languages for everything (content, commit messages, pull requests, issues, comments)

## Issues

<p> When opening an issue, be sure that it hasn't been already mentioned in another issue or already being solved by a PR. </p>
<p> Before opening the issue, clearly state the problem and make sure it's reproducible. Also, if the issue can be fixed by you, we recommend opening a PR too </p>

## Pull Requests

For PRs, please follow the [Github flow](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork): create a fork of the repository, create your own branch, do commits, push changes to your branch, create a pull request. The destination branch of the pull requests is the `main` branch.

Make sure each commit corresponds to **one** code / content change only. If there are multiple commits for a given change, squash the commits.

Also, make sure one PR covers **one** topic.

Use commit messages with verbs at imperative mood: "Add README".

Also, you should sign the commits using `-s`. Besides, the commit title message shouldn't be longer than 50 chars and each line of the body longer than 72 chars.
